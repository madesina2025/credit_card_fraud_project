# 🚨 Real-Time Credit Card Fraud Detection Platform

An end-to-end fraud detection platform that combines Machine Learning, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Kafka Streaming, Docker, and Dash Analytics to detect, monitor, and analyze fraudulent credit card transactions in real time.

The solution provides both operational fraud monitoring and executive-level fraud analytics through a modern dashboard and API-driven architecture.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

Financial institutions process millions of transactions daily, making fraud detection a critical business requirement.

This platform provides:

- Real-time transaction scoring
- Fraud probability prediction
- Fraud risk classification
- Fraud alert generation
- Fraud exposure analysis
- Executive fraud dashboards
- Streaming-ready architecture
- Enterprise deployment readiness
